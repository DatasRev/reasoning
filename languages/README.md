I think we should use a lazy rule: if anybody - who doesn't speak hungarian well - comes to our event we speak in english.
The logs of our events should be bilingual, but we understand if somebody does not have enough time to write it (also we assume good intentions)
At the moment english is the language of communication in our region, and you will find 95% of books and other trainging courses in english. Without that language you cut off yourself from growth
