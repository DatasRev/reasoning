I would go with Levente's lazy rule - if someone who doesn't speak hungarian comes to the workshop, we should speak english. The material on GitHub could be bilingual.

It think there are meanings lost in translation. I saw some very respected Hungarian professionals teaching english   |HU   | 3  |        and I saw that they could not explain what they wanted well in English and used very simple sentences.                             Statistics,     ML is very complicated taught in Hungarian, it would be much more complicated in                        English.  I would support the idea  to hold a workshop in English for special guests.    Event logs                   could be written only in English to save writing it                     twice becasuse those are simpler texts.

I think we should use a lazy rule: if anybody - who doesn't speak hungarian well - comes to our event we speak in english.
The logs of our events should be bilingual, but we understand if somebody does not have enough time to write it (also we assume good intentions)
At the moment english is the language of communication in our region, and you will find 95% of books and other trainging courses in english. Without that language you cut off yourself from growth
